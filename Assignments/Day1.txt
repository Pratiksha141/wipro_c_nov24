-In C, the input and output functions are primarily used for reading data from the user or 
from a file and printing data to the screen or writing it to a file.
 The standard input/output functions are part of the C standard library, 
 particularly found in the <stdio.h> header file.
 
 Prototypes are listed below:
 
 1.gets(): used to read a string (space is also part of the i/p)
