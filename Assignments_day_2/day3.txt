Why an un initialized pointer is called as wild pointer ?
Ans-
An uninitialized pointer is called a wild pointer because 
it points to a random or unpredictable memory location, 
potentially causing unexpected behavior or errors in a program.

Hereâ€™s why:

Random Value: When a pointer is declared but not initialized, 
it holds an indeterminate value, 
which means it points to a memory address that is not defined by the programmer.
 This value is essentially "wild" or unpredictable.

Undefined Behavior: Since the pointer is pointing to a random memory location, 
dereferencing it can lead to accessing invalid or restricted memory areas,
 leading to crashes, data corruption, or other erratic behavior.
 This is a form of undefined behavior in programming.


Example:

int* ptr;  // Uninitialized pointer
*ptr = 10;  // Dereferencing a wild pointer, may cause unpredictable behavior.
